SalaryScout
SalaryScout is a lightweight Hugging Face Space that lets you predict a person's salary based on their years of experience using a simple linear regression model. It’s perfect for demonstrating core regression concepts in an interactive way.

Key Features
Simple linear regression: Trains a model using years of experience (independent variable) to predict salary (dependent variable).

Interactive interface: Built with Gradio (or your preferred framework) to allow users to input experience values and instantly see salary predictions.

Educational purpose: Helps users grasp how linear regression works—including the slope and intercept of the fitted line.

Live demo: Users can experiment by inputting different experience values to see how the prediction changes.

How It Works
The model fits a line of the form:

Edit
salary = m * experience + c
where:

m = slope (amount salary changes per year of experience)

c = intercept (base salary with zero years of experience)

Uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to minimize the sum of squared errors between actual salary data and predictions

Once trained, the model predicts salary for new input values.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Required Python packages: gradio, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy (add these to requirements.txt)

Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/ASHCHAT/SalaryScout
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app locally (if using Gradio, adjust accordingly if another framework is used):

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The Space will launch locally—input the years of experience and get predicted salary instantly.

To deploy or update on Hugging Face:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Add simple linear regression app"
git push
Model Insights
With simple linear regression, you can evaluate performance using metrics such as:

R² (coefficient of determination): Indicates model fit—closer to 1 is better.

Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measure average squared (or square root) prediction error

Demo Usage
Input: Number of years of experience (e.g., 3, 5, 10)

Output: Predicted salary (e.g., ₹35,000)

Why It Matters
Demonstrates the fundamentals of regression analysis.

Offers an intuitive way to see the impact of experience on salary.

Great for educational projects, interviews, or portfolio showcasing how ML can be applied in real-world scenarios.
